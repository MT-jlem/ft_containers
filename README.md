# ft_containers

## Overview

The `ft_containers` project is a C++ project focused on re-implementing essential containers from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). This project is part of the curriculum to enhance understanding of the standard library containers and their implementation. The main goal is to replicate the behavior of key C++98 standard containers such as `vector`, `map`, `set`, and `stack` .

## Requirements

The project's primary requirements include:

- Re-implement the `vector`, `map`, `set`, and `stack` containers.
- Ensure compliance with the C++98 standard.
- Implement related C++98 features, even deprecated ones.
- Follow specific compilation guidelines.
- Conform to coding conventions and avoid memory leakage.
- Utilize standard C++ features and the standard library without external libraries.

## Project Guidelines

- The project must be compiled using the C++ compiler with specific flags.
- Containers must follow the Orthodox Canonical form, avoiding unneeded functionalities.
- Private or protected access should be used for non-public elements.
- Proper naming conventions and include guards should be maintained.
- Clean and readable code is encouraged.

## Conclusion

The `ft_containers` project is an opportunity to dive deep into the internals of C++ standard containers, adhere to strict C++98 standards, and practice good coding conventions.
